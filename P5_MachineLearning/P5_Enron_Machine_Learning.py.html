# # Enron Submission Free-Response Questions

# ### 1. Summarize for us the goal of this project and how machine learning is useful in trying to accomplish it. As part of your answer, give some background on the dataset and how it can be used to answer the project question. Were there any outliers in the data when you got it, and how did you handle those?  [relevant rubric items: “data exploration”, “outlier investigation”]
# 

# #### In late 2001, Enron, an American energy company, filed for bankruptcy after one of the largest financial scandals in corporate history. After the company's collapse, over 600,000 emails generated by 158 Enron employees - now known as the Enron Corpus - were acquired by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission during its investigation. The data was then uploaded online, and since then, a number of people and organizations have graciously prepared, cleaned and organized the dataset that is available to the public today (a few years later, financial data of top Enron executives were released following their trial).
# 
# #### Totally 145 data points in data set and have two class:POI/non POI. Two features in the data: 14 Finance and 6 Email.But there are many defect value in data set which like loan_advaces.
# 
# #### Through salary and bonus scatters graph to found abnormal value,but that value was cause by total orignal value sum("Total"),So need to cancel this abnormal value.After cancel this "total" value,it's also found two abnormal values: at least 5 millions bonus and over 1 million salary.the suspicious person to correspond these two value is LAY KENNETH L and SKILLING JEFFREY K.From the Enron background to realized these two person are core person in Enron.In other words.these tow values are key value.

# ### 2. What features did you end up using in your POI identifier, and what selection process did you use to pick them? Did you have to do any scaling? Why or why not? As part of the assignment, you should attempt to engineer your own feature that does not come ready-made in the dataset -- explain what feature you tried to make, and the rationale behind it. (You do not necessarily have to use it in the final analysis, only engineer and test it.) In your feature selection step, if you used an algorithm like a decision tree, please also give the feature importances of the features that you use, and if you used an automated feature selection function like SelectKBest, please report the feature scores and reasons for your choice of parameter values.  [relevant rubric items: “create new features”, “intelligently select features”, “properly scale features”]
# 
# 

# #### First of all,I was cancel the total_payments and total_stock_value,because those are sum of other values.And other NAN I was choice to leave behind it maybe have other hinting information of values.
# 
# #### Base on those values I was created tow new value "from_this_person_to_poi_ratio"and"from_poi_to_this_person_ratio"which means"the ratio of suspicious person send POI mails to totally send mails"and "the ratio of suspicious person recived POI mails to totally recive mails".Because of send and recive mails ratio can show the suspicious person who are the POI.
# 
# #### After the treatment the values the evaluation result as below：

# In[39]:


get_ipython().magic('run poi_id.py')


# In[40]:


import operator
import pandas as pd
get_ipython().magic('matplotlib inline')
selected_features = dict()
for f in features_list[1:]:
    selected_features[f] = feature_scores[f]
sorted_features = sorted(selected_features.items(), key=operator.itemgetter(1), reverse=True)
indices = []
scores = []
for t in sorted_features:
    indices.append(t[0])
    scores.append(t[1])
df = pd.DataFrame(scores, index=indices)
df.plot(kind='barh').invert_yaxis()


# #### In the seclected feature I was used automatic feature to choice SelectKBest to check of the values score,and cancel the lowest score 2.0. I also cancel the much more NA features like("loan_advances").From analysis graph,the score "from_this_person_to_poi_ratio" over 12.5 and the score "from_poi_to_this_person_ratio only 2.5 which means the ratio of suspicious peron send mails to POI mails to total send mails can explain the problem.

# ### 3.What algorithm did you end up using? What other one(s) did you try? How did model performance differ between algorithms? [relevant rubric item: “pick an algorithm”]

# #### I end up to using Support Vector Machines algorithm.In other hand,I also tried algorithm of"Gaussian Naive-Bayes","Decision Tree Classifier"and "AdaBoost".I used F1 score to evaluated performance of algorithms then support vector machines get 0.496;Gussian Naive-Bayes get 0.331;AdaBoost and Decision Tree Classifier respectove scores of 0.26 and 0.235.

# ### 4. What does it mean to tune the parameters of an algorithm, and what can happen if you don’t do this well?  How did you tune the parameters of your particular algorithm? What parameters did you tune? (Some algorithms do not have parameters that you need to tune -- if this is the case for the one you picked, identify and briefly explain how you would have done it for the model that was not your final choice or a different model that does utilize parameter tuning, e.g. a decision tree classifier).  [relevant rubric items: “discuss parameter tuning”, “tune the algorithm”]

# #### Tune the parameters of an algorithm means to choice the best parameters of an algorithm to improve performace of particular algorithm.the particular algorithm can't up to stamdard if it don't tune the parameters of an algoithm(lower f1 value).For my choiced support vector machines algorithm.I used Pipeline+GridSearchCV to tuned the parameters.Used Pipeline to set up:at first,use standard feature scaling(SVM algorithm need) and PCA;Then through GridSearch CV and Param_grid parameters transmit parameter C,kernal,class_weight and gamma etc.different values.Lastly,according to GridSearch CV gave optimum parameter group.

# ### 5. What is validation, and what’s a classic mistake you can make if you do it wrong? How did you validate your analysis?  [relevant rubric items: “discuss validation”, “validation strategy”]
# 
# 

# #### Validation in machine learning consists of evaluating a model using data that wasn't touched during the training process.A classic mistake is to ignore this rule,hence obtaining overly optimistic results due to overfitting the training data then will seen very poor performance.
# 
# #### I used three parts to evaluate an algorithm: f1 score,precision and recall. Firstly used GridSearchCV to validate the evaluate an algorithm,then used estimate_classifer function to calculate f1 score and choice the highest f1 score as final clf.
# 
# #### The estimate_classifier function principle:  StratifiedShuffleSplit algorithm effectively uses a series of train/validation/test set splits, and through to changed sequence of parameters to validate and test.after that calling sklearn.metrics.f1_score to calculate f1 score.used f1 average to evaluating the performance of an algorithm.

# ### 6. Give at least 2 evaluation metrics and your average performance for each of them.  Explain an interpretation of your metrics that says something human-understandable about your algorithm’s performance. [relevant rubric item: “usage of evaluation metrics”

# #### From my choice the Suppore Vector Machines algorithm.the best performance of parameter is C=1.0,class_weight ='balanced',kernel='sigmoid'and gamma =0.10000000000000001,PCA's n_components parameter = 4.
# 
# #### Precision = 0.331 which means there have 33.1% really POI in mark of POI person ;recall rate is 0.862 that means really POI person have 86.2% was corrected mark.
