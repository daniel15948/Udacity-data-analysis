### 1.P0_Bike_Share_Analysis

* In this project, I perform an exploratory analysis on data provided by Motivate, a bike-share system provider for many major cities in the United States. i compare the system usage between three large cities: New York City, Chicago, and Washington, DC. I also see there are differences within each system for those users that are registered, regular users and those users that are short-term, casual users.

### 2.P1_Statistics

* In a Stroop task, participants are presented with a list of words, with each word displayed in a color of ink. The participant’s task is to say out loud the color of the ink in which the word is printed. The task has two conditions: a congruent words condition, and an incongruent words condition. In the congruent words condition, the words being displayed are color words whose names match the colors in which they are printed: for example RED, BLUE. In the incongruent words condition, the words displayed are color words whose names do not match the colors in which they are printed: for example PURPLE, ORANGE. In each case, we measure the time it takes to name the ink colors in equally-sized lists. Each participant will go through and record a time from each condition.

### 4.P4_Exploratory_Data_Analysis

* In this project,I will analyze the Red Wine Data and try to understand which variables are responsible for the quality of the wine.
The data-set contains 11 chemical characteristics beside a quality from 1 to 10 from at least 3 wine experts for 1599 different wines.

### 5.P5_MachineLearning

* The Enron fraud is the largest case of corporate fraud in American history. Founded in 1985, Enron Corporation went bankrupt by end of 2001 due to widespread corporate fraud and corruption. Before its fall, Fortune magazine had named Enron "America's most innovative company" for six consecutive years. So what happened? Who were the culprits?¶
In this project, I will play detective and build a classification algorithm to predict a person of interest identifier (POI) based on email and financial features in the combined dataset. A POI is anyone who has been indicted, settled without admitting the guilt and testified in exchange for immunity. We will check our predicted POI against actual POI in the dataset to evaluate our prediction.
