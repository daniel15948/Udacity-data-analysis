### Summary

##### There are 1157 baseball players information from baseball data set,which include information of players height,weight,hand habits(right hand,left hand and both hands),batting average score (avg) and home run score (hr).The purpose of analysis data set is creating a data visualization to represent the relationship of player's height,weight and hand habits between player's batting average score and home run score.

### Reference
* [Batting average Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average)
* [Home run](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run)

### Design

##### The Information of baseball players has height,weight,hand habits,avg and hr.I was thinking design data visulaization to show the avg and hr have relate with height,weight and hand habits.I used three kind of color to repesent players left,right,and both hand. I have chosen to create a data story which used the Tableau story tool.

##### After received feedback I cleaned Null data and 0 data and created a new variable "N" for number of players who having the same weight and height.

#### Feedback

1. Page 1:the number of records just showed right handedness users are more than others,but it didn't show the handedness users relate with performance of players.
2. Page 2: Handedness with weight and height doesn't have any meaning of analysis,because from page view both,right and left handedness users have similar weight and height.
3. Page 3: Circles are more closed.
4. Page 4: Although the right hand users have higher sum of avg,but should indicate how many right hand users in total players.


### Reflection

From data visualization point of view,baseball player's batting average,home run with player's height,weight and hand habits are not much related.
