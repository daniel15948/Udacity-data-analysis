## Baseball player performace data visualization

### Project link review


### Summary

##### There are 1157 baseball players information from baseball data set,which include information of players height,weight,hand habits(right hand,left hand and both hands),batting average score (avg) and home run score (hr).The purpose of analysis data set is creating a data visualization to represent the relationship of player's height,weight and hand habits between player's batting average score and home run score.

### Reference
* [Batting average Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average)
* [Home run](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run)
* [Scatterplots in D3](https://peterbeshai.com/scatterplot-in-d3-with-voronoi-interaction.html)

### Make effective data visualization
#### Version 1(index1.html)

1. Using height data as x axis and weight data as y axis.
2. Scatter plots are used to show the distribution of baseball players.

#### Feedback

1. Without any data points shows batting average(avg) and home run(hr).
2. Without project title.
3. Scatter plots are overlapping together that couldn't show any data.

#### Version 2(index2.html)

1. Used R program to clean the data set which cleaned NULL data and 0 data.the new file name:new_baseball_data.
2. Using height data points as x axis and weight data as y axis.
3. Added ellipse to show avg ,hr and the number of people when the mouse point into ellipse.
4. Three colors means right hand,left hand and both hand.


### Reflection

1. From data visualization point of view,baseball player'sbatting average,home run with player's height,weight and hand habits are not much related.
