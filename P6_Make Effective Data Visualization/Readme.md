### Summary

##### There are 1157 baseball players information from baseball data set,which include information of players height,weight,hand habits(right hand,left hand and both hands),batting average score (avg) and home run score (hr).The purpose of analysis data set is creating a data visualization to represent the relationship of player's height,weight and hand habits between player's batting average score and home run score.

### Reference
* [Batting average Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average)
* [Home run](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run)
* [Scatterplots in D3](https://peterbeshai.com/scatterplot-in-d3-with-voronoi-interaction.html)

### Design

##### The Information of baseball players has height,weight,hand habits,avg and hr.I was thinking design data visulaization to show the avg and hr have relate with height,weight and hand habits.I used three kind of color to repesent players left,right,and both hand.when the mouse move to the ellipse that will show height,weight,hr and avg score.I added the number of people in each ellipse.the data visualization I used D3.js.
##### After received feedback I cleaned Null data and 0 data and added ellipses to show height,weight,avg,he and number of people in each ellipses. 
 
#### Feedback

1. Without any data points shows batting average(avg) and home run(hr).
2. Without project title.
3. Scatter plots are overlapping together that couldn't show any data.


### Reflection

From data visualization point of view,baseball player'sbatting average,home run with player's height,weight and hand habits are not much related.
